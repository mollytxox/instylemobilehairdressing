    <p class="testimonial-text">
        Over a number of years, my hair became quite brittle and to my horror, a couple of years ago I started to
        develop a bald spot at my hairline, above my forehead. <br>
        It became my obsession to try to conceal what was happening, spending a lot of time consumed with worry about
        windy days and whether others could see what I was so desperately trying to hide.<br>
        One of my greatest challenges was going to the hairdresser and sitting in a busy salon under lights, trying not
        to feel bad about what was before me in the mirror, eyes down, not wanting to see others staring at me.<br>
        A biopsy confirmed that I had a type of alopecia, and it was at that point I accepted that this was not going to
        get better, and in fact, potentially it was going to get a lot worse.<br>
        Out of desperation I googled mobile hairdressers and found In Style Mobile Hairdressing.<br> I will never forget
        the
        day that Jo arrived at my door for that first consultation. <br>Jo walked in, hugged me and said, “I’m here with
        you
        to help you on your journey, whatever that may be”.<br>
        I felt a huge sense of relief, and from that moment on, I knew it was going to be ok. <br>After some months, I
        ordered my first Follea wig. I can honestly say that it has changed my life. <br>I have regained my confidence;
        I
        feel safe and secure and never worry about the weather!<br>
        My hair will never grow back, but even if it did, I would not want to stop wearing my wig. I have since bought a
        second one and I love them both.<br>
        Jo is an amazing hairdresser. <br>She has supported me so well over the past couple of years – I look forward to
        her
        regular visits when she cuts what is left of my hair in the privacy of my own home, and she also styles my wigs,
        and always does such a fantastic job.<br><br>
        I cannot recommend Jo highly enough – she is a talented hairdresser, and a good friend nowadays. Thank you Jo
        <br><br>

    <h2 id="testimonial-subtitle">Second testimonial</h2>

    <p class="testimonial-text">
        I found Jo at Instyle Mobile Hair whilst searching for a specialist that could help me source a quality solution
        for my thinning hair. <br>After a four year period of illness I had lost a significant volume of hair and was
        struggling emotionally and was unable to style my own hair. <br> My hairdresser at the time told me bluntly that
        I was losing a huge amount of hair at the basin, which made me embarrassed and fearful of going back to the
        hairdresser. <br>My research finally lead me to the Transitions website.<br> I was so excited to find that Jo
        represented their products in New Zealand and was based in Wellington!<br> The fact that she would also travel
        to my home to treat and colour my own hair and help me to source and fit a hair topper was reassuring.<br>
        Meeting Jo at
        that point in my hair journey was extremely important.<br> She was very empathetic and helpful and I began to
        feel a
        bit hopeful that I could find something which would help me to start looking (and hence feeling) like myself
        once again.<br> I now see Jo regularly at my home and she continues to be so helpful to me on my hair journey.
        <br>
        I have purchased two hair toppers from her thus far and we continue to experiment with colours and styles.
        <br>It is a
        process and I’m gaining more confidence as time goes by, helped enormously by Jo’s support and professional
        knowledge. <br>Unfortunately, there are thousands of people dealing with hair loss and thinning hair and it can
        be a very tough time.<br> I encourage anyone who is in this type of situation, dealing with hair loss for any
        reason
        whatsoever, to seek out Jo’s expert services and her access to these amazing products.<br> Its a very positive
        step
        in the right direction and Jo is just wonderful!
